## Requirements

* PHP 7.4 (main, 1.x)

## Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). There are two ways to add miniflex to your project.

From the composer CLI:

```sh
./composer.phar require modethirteen/miniflex
```

Or add modethirteen/miniflex to your project's composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "modethirteen/miniflex": "dev-main"
    }
}
```

`dev-main` is the main development branch. If you are using miniflex in a production environment, it is advised that you use a stable release.

Assuming you have setup Composer's autoloader, miniflex can be found in the `modethirteen\Crypto\` namespace.
